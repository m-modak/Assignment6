# I didn't like how the camera never moved with the player, so I made a code with my limited ability for the camera to track the player. I then realized that there was a code for that in your github. Hoever, since I made that code myself with the help of google, I think it can be considered a modification. I also modified the button used to make the player jump. I didn't like that only three of the arrow keys were used, so i changed the button code to a key code and made it the arrow. I think it makes the game a little more accessible so you can play it with one hand.
# I hated writing the win and lose triggers. I made it pop up in the debug because there were no clear instructions on how to create it AND how to create it in a 2D game. I tried so hard to add on trigger enter collider code in hopes that when the player and the small transparent sprite I placed on the last platform would trigger the win log, but it didn't work.i had to set it so that if the player was at a certain x and y value that corresponded to the last platform, the win would show. (this is in response to the third prompt, how i solved these challenges.)
# I'm most proud of the way I programmed the lose trigger, because it took a lot of work to figure out how it worked and where on the y axis the player could have to be in for it to occur. the game can still be played like normal afterwards because I haven't figured out how to stop the game.
